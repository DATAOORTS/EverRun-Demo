We're using a straightforward method to generate the Fibonacci sequence of set of numbers. However, it's essential to note that the computational complexity of this function is exponential, precisely O(2^n), where 'n' signifies the input value.

This exponential complexity stems from the recursive nature of the function. In the worst-case scenario, each recursive call spawns two more recursive calls, leading to an exponential increase in function calls as 'n' grows. Consequently, the function's efficiency decreases significantly for larger values of 'n' due to the considerable computational overhead.
